        <h3>Role: Product Inventor & Project Leader</h3>
        <p>
          In this research-led defense project, I served as the Research Strategist and Concept Engineer to conceptualize a modular GPS-guided missile system with the ability to divide mid-air and independently engage multiple targets. The design aimed to revolutionize conventional missile functionality by introducing a decentralized control architecture, where each module could operate autonomously after detachment. I developed logical frameworks for synchronized module separation, real-time trajectory prediction, and precision warhead targeting, utilizing embedded platforms for onboard processing and GPS navigation. The project addressed key challenges such as stability during separation, communication redundancy, and error minimization in high-speed, dynamic environments. By integrating multi-target guidance logic and embedded control systems, this research demonstrated the potential for scalable, intelligent, and flexible defense solutions aligned with the future of smart warfare technologies.
