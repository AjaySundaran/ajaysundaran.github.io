        <h3>Role: Product Inventor & Project Leader</h3>
        <p>

          As the team leader and primary innovator behind the Z-Band project, I conceptualized, designed, and led the development of a fully functional wearable safety device aimed at protecting school girls and women from abduction and assault. The Z-Band is a smart wristband integrated with motion sensors, a gyroscope, and a microcontroller that automatically detects if the wearer’s hands are forcibly tied and triggers an emergency response without any manual input. I developed the core algorithms, wrote most of the embedded code, and managed the hardware-software integration for both the wristband and the receiver-transmission unit. The receiver unit, also designed and built by me, uses GPS and GSM modules to transmit the victim’s live location and environmental audio to pre-registered contacts, including parents and authorities—completely independent of mobile phones or subscriptions. By overcoming limitations of existing safety tools and building a fully working prototype, our project offers a reliable, real-time safety solution that can be deployed in schools and public spaces to significantly enhance women's security.
