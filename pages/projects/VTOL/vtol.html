        <h3>Role: Product Inventor & Project Leader</h3>
        <p>
          
        As part of my final-year capstone project in Aerospace Engineering at VIT Bhopal University, I led the comprehensive design and simulation of a next-generation Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft, engineered for urban air mobility, defense logistics, and compact aerial operations. The project aimed to develop a small-scale VTOL aircraft concept capable of vertical lift and efficient horizontal cruise, combining the operational flexibility of multirotor drones with the aerodynamic efficiency of fixed-wing flight. After conducting an in-depth literature review and evaluating historical and contemporary VTOL platforms—including tiltrotor, tilt-wing, ducted fan, and hybrid designs—I selected a hybrid lift + cruise configuration that offered design simplicity, stable flight characteristics, and modular scalability.

The 3D structural model of the aircraft was developed using SolidWorks, with a strong emphasis on aerostructural optimization and lightweight construction using carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP). Aerodynamic behavior and performance were evaluated using ANSYS Fluent (CFD) to analyze airflow distribution, lift-to-drag ratios, propeller downwash effects, and transition aerodynamics. Special care was taken to design airfoils with minimal flow separation and efficient lift generation across varying angles of attack.

On the systems side, I designed a theoretical propulsion layout using brushless DC (BLDC) motors, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), and Li-Po batteries, ensuring the overall thrust-to-weight ratio was sufficient for both hover and forward motion. I also proposed a control architecture based on PID tuning and microcontroller-based flight stabilization to handle multi-modal transitions, including hover, vertical lift, and cruise. While this phase of the project was limited to design, analysis, and systems planning, it provided deep insight into the interdisciplinary challenges of VTOL development—from structural design and materials to propulsion integration and dynamic stability.

This project strengthened my skills in aerospace system integration, computational modeling, control theory, and sustainable aircraft design—laying the groundwork for future work in UAV systems, eVTOL development, and autonomous air mobility platforms.
